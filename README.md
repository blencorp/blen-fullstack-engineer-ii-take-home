# BLEN -- Senior Software Developer II (Full Stack) Take-Home

## Overview

Build a **Task Tracker with AI Features** -- a full-stack application for managing projects and tasks, enhanced with LLM-powered capabilities. The data model, test suite, mock LLM service, and infrastructure are all provided. Your job is to implement the API endpoints, AI integration, business logic, and a functional UI.

**Time expectation:** 1-2 days. Focus on clean, working code over polish.

## What's Provided

- **Database schema** (Drizzle ORM) with migrations and seed data
- **Docker Compose** with PostgreSQL + a mock LLM service -- no external APIs or keys needed
- **Mock LLM service** -- an OpenAI-compatible chat completions API that returns deterministic responses (see `mock-llm/server.ts` for behavior)
- **Pre-written test suite** (49 tests) -- your implementation must pass all of them
- **API route scaffolds** with detailed JSDoc describing expected behavior and Drizzle hints
- **LLM client scaffold** (`lib/llm.ts`) -- implement the wrapper around the mock LLM
- **TypeScript types** including valid status transitions
- **Page scaffolds** for `app/page.tsx` (project list) and `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx` (project detail) with TODO comments
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui** configured for styling

## What You Build

### 1. Core API Endpoints (tested -- same as SE I)

Implement the route handlers in `app/api/`:

**Projects**
- `GET /api/projects` -- List projects with optional status filter, include task counts
- `POST /api/projects` -- Create project (unique name required)
- `GET /api/projects/:id` -- Get project with task counts by status
- `PATCH /api/projects/:id` -- Update project fields
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id` -- Delete project (blocked if tasks are in_progress or in_review)

**Tasks**
- `GET /api/tasks` -- List tasks with filters (status, priority, assignee, projectId) and pagination
- `POST /api/tasks` -- Create task (must reference valid project)
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` -- Get task with parent project info
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` -- Update task (status changes must follow valid transitions)
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` -- Delete task

**Business Logic:**
- Task status transitions are enforced. See `lib/types.ts` for the transition map.
- Cannot delete a project with tasks in `in_progress` or `in_review` status
- Project names must be unique

**Key files:**
- `lib/schema.ts` -- Drizzle schema (tables, enums, relations, inferred types)
- `lib/db.ts` -- Database client (drizzle + postgres.js)
- `lib/types.ts` -- Status transition map and API types

### 2. AI Integration (tested)

Implement the LLM client and AI endpoints:

**LLM Client** (`lib/llm.ts`)
- Implement `chatCompletion()` to call the mock LLM's OpenAI-compatible API
- Handle errors: service unreachable, invalid responses, timeouts
- The mock LLM runs at `$LLM_BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions`

**AI Endpoints**
- `POST /api/ai/categorize` -- Auto-categorize a task (bug, feature, improvement, documentation) and update its labels
- `POST /api/ai/summarize` -- Generate a project status summary from its tasks
- `POST /api/ai/suggest-priority` -- Suggest priority level for a task description

The mock LLM returns deterministic responses based on keywords in the system prompt and user content. Read `mock-llm/server.ts` to understand the response patterns -- your system prompts must include specific keywords to trigger the correct response type.

### 3. Dashboard UI (manually reviewed)

Build a functional UI **using Next.js App Router patterns**:

**App Router Requirements:**
- **File-system routing:** Use `app/page.tsx` for the projects list and `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx` for project detail. Scaffolds for both pages are provided.
- **Server Components:** The default -- use them for data fetching and layout. Only add `'use client'` to components that need interactivity (forms, dialogs, click handlers).
- **`Link` navigation:** Use `next/link` for client-side navigation between pages (e.g., project cards link to `/projects/[id]`).
- **Async params:** In Next.js 16, dynamic route params are async: `const { id } = await params`.

**UI features to include:**
- Everything from the core task tracker (projects, tasks, CRUD, filters)
- A way to trigger AI categorization on tasks
- Display AI-suggested priorities when creating tasks
- Show project summaries powered by the LLM

### 4. Solution Design (written)

Complete the questions in `SOLUTION_DESIGN.md`. The SE II questions focus on production AI architecture, security, and system design at scale.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ and bun

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start PostgreSQL and Mock LLM
docker compose up -d

# Wait for services to be healthy, then run migrations and seed
bun run db:migrate
bun run db:seed

# Start the dev server
bun run dev
```

The app is available at http://localhost:3002

### Verify the Mock LLM

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:11434/health

# Test a categorization request
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "Categorize the following task."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Fix the login bug on mobile"}
    ]
  }'
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the full test suite (requires db + mock-llm running)
bun test

# Run linting and type checks
bun run lint
bun run typecheck

# Run everything (typecheck + lint + tests)
bun run check
```

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Reset database (drop and re-migrate)
bun run db:reset

# Then re-seed
bun run db:seed

# Generate a new migration after schema changes
bun run db:generate
```

## Submission

1. Ensure all 49 tests pass (`bun test`)
2. Ensure `bun run lint` and `bun run typecheck` pass clean
3. Complete `SOLUTION_DESIGN.md`
4. Push to a **private** GitHub repo and share access, or send as a zip file
5. Include any notes about your approach in the solution design doc
